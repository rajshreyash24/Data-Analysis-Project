Data Analysis Project entails the systematic examination of data to extract valuable information and support data-driven decision-making. By employing a structured approach, this project aims to uncover meaningful patterns, relationships, and trends within the data. 

The analysis process involves data cleaning, transforming, and applying statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights and draw conclusions. The project's outcomes can offer valuable insights, such as improving operational efficiency, identifying growth opportunities, or enhancing customer experience.
